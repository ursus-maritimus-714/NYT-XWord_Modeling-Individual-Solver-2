# Predictive Modeling of Individual Solver 2 (IS2) Performance on the New York Times Crossword Puzzle

## Introduction

### Project Overview and Data Sources
This summary reports on the results of predictive modeling of my own (Individual Solver 1; IS1) performance on all puzzles issued during a 3+ year (Oct. 2020 - Feb. 2024) sample of the [New York Times (NYT) crossword puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords). Previously, I conducted a [comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IS1 performance](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Individual-Solver-1/blob/main/README.md) over this sample period. From this EDA, numerous features pertaining to both the puzzles themselves as well as to IS1 past performance were identified as candidate features for predictive modeling of IS1 solve times.    

Without access to two specific data sources this project would not have been possible. The first, [XWord Info: New York Times Crossword Answers and Insights](https://www.xwordinfo.com/), was my source for data on the puzzles themselves. This included a number of proprietary metrics pertaining to the grids, answers, clues and constructors. XWord Info has a contract with NYT for access to the raw data underlying these metrics, but I unfortunately do not. Therefore, I will not be able to share raw or processed data that I've acquired from their site. Nonetheless, [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with all of my Python code for analysis and figure generation can be found [here](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-Modeling-Individual-Solver-1/tree/main/notebooks). The second, [XWStats](xwstats.com), was my source for historical solve time data for both IS1 and for the "Global Median Solver" (GMS). XWStats (Matt) derives the GMS solve time as that at the 50th percentile out of ~1-2K individual solvers providing their solve times per puzzle. In the context of IS1 modeling, historical GMS solve times were used to derive a "Strength of Schedule" adjustment to features capturing IS1 past performance prior to a given solve time to be predicted (see Methods section for details). Additionally, please also see the [EDA](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Global-Median-Solver?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) and [predictive modeling](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-Modeling-Global-Median-Solver/blob/main/README.md) of GMS solve time that I have previously completed. 

Please visit, explore and strongly consider financially supporting both of these wonderful sites; XWord Info via [membership purchase at one of several levels](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Pay) and XWStats via [BuyMeACoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/xwstats).
